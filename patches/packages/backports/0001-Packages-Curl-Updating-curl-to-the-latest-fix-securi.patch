-Subject: [PATCH] curl-wolfssl.m4: error out if wolfSSL is not usable
-MIME-Version: 1.0
-Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
-Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
-
-When I explicitly declare, that I would like to have curl built with
-wolfSSL support using `--with-wolfssl` configure option, then I would
-expect, that either I endup with curl having that support, for example
-in form of https support or it wouldn't be available at all.
-
-Downstream projects like for example OpenWrt build curl wolfSSL variant
-with `--with-wolfssl` already, but in certain corner cases it does fail:
-
-  configure:25299: checking for wolfSSL_Init in -lwolfssl
-  configure:25321: x86_64-openwrt-linux-musl-gcc -o conftest [snip]
-  In file included from target-x86_64_musl/usr/include/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/dsa.h:33,
-                   from target-x86_64_musl/usr/include/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/asn_public.h:35,
-                  from target-x86_64_musl/usr/include/wolfssl/ssl.h:35,
-                   from conftest.c:47:
-  target-x86_64_musl/usr/include/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/integer.h:37:14: fatal error: wolfssl/wolfcrypt/sp_int.h: No such file or directory
-       #include <wolfssl/wolfcrypt/sp_int.h>
-                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  compilation terminated.
-
-and in the end thus produces curl without https support:
-
- curl: (1) Protocol "https" not supported or disabled in libcurl
-
-So fix it, by making the working wolfSSL mandatory and error out in
-configure step when that's not the case:
-
- checking for wolfSSL_Init in -lwolfssl... no
- configure: error: --with-wolfssl but wolfSSL was not found or doesn't work
